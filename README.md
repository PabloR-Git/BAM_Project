## What is an Open Reading Frame (ORF) ?

An ORF is usually defined as a stretch of DNA containing at least 100 codons that begins with a start codon and ends
with a stop codon.

| Stop codon | Start codon |
|------------|-------------|
| UAG        | sss         |
| UAA        | sss         |
| UAG        | s           |


ORF analysis correctly identifies more than 90 percent of the genes in yeast and bacteria.
