## What is an Open Reading Frame (ORF) ?

An ORF is usually defined as a stretch of DNA containing at least 100 codons that begins with a start codon and ends
with a stop codon.

| Organism     | Start codon   | Stop codon    |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Eukaryotes   | ATG           | TAG, TAA, TGA |
| Prokaryotes  | ATG, GTG, TTG | TAG, TAA, TGA |
| Mitochondria | ATG, ATA      | TAG, TAA, TGA |


ORF analysis correctly identifies more than 90 percent of the genes in yeast and bacteria.
